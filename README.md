# pig-game
Pig game is a simple and fun jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points.

## Gameplay
Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a `1` is rolled or the player decides to `hold`:
- If the player rolls a `1`, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, that number is added to their turn current score and the player continues to play (roll the die).
- If a player decides to `hold`, their turn current score is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- And the first player to score 100 or more points wins!`
